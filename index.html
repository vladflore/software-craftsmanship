                    Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of
                    the software developers. It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the
                    mainstream software industry, including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer
                    accountability.

                        In 1992, Jack W. Reeves' essay <span style="font-style: italic;">What Is Software Design?</span>
                        suggested that <span style="color: #a9c23f;">software development is more a craft than an
                            engineering discipline</span>.

                        with each other, but more often we are in competition against people and companies that do not
                        share our values. </p>
