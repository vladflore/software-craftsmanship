                Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of
                the software developers. It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the
                mainstream software industry, including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer
                accountability.

                    In 1992, Jack W. Reeves' essay <span style="font-style: italic;">What Is Software Design?</span>
                    suggested that <span style="color: #a9c23f;">software development is more a craft than an

                    In 1999, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Pragmatic Programmer</span> was published. Its

                    <span style="color: #a9c23f;">programmers go through stages in their professional

                    In 2008, a number of aspiring software craftsmen met in Libertyville, Illinois, with the intent
                    of establishing a set of principles for software craftsmanship. <span

                    going to make each other stronger. By making each other stronger, we are making our companies

                    with each other, but more often we are in competition against people and companies that do not
                    share our values. </p>
